## Getting started

1. Create an account on [componentsearchengine.com](https://componentsearchengine.com/) if you don't have one already.
2. Download a prebuilt version of library-loader from the [releases page](https://github.com/olback/library-loader/releases).

### Extra steps for Library Loader CLI
3. Generate a config file to store your settings in.  
Option 1: Generate a global config `library-loader -gh`  
Option 2: Generate a local config `library-loader -g` (current working directory).
4. Edit the config file to your liking. Global config locations:  
Windows: `C:\Users\%user%\AppData\Roaming\LibraryLoader.toml`  
Linux: `/home/$USER/.config/LibraryLoader.toml`  
Mac: `$HOME/Library/Preferences/LibraryLoader.toml`

### Build from source
1. Make sure you have the rust toolchain installed.
2. Download the source. `git clone https://github.com/olback/library-loader.git`.
3. `cd` into `library-loader/ll-[cli/gui]`.
4. `cargo build --release --bin library-loader-[cli/bin]`

#### Extra steps for Library Loader GUI
5. `sudo ./install.sh`

## What/Why?
This is an implementation of [https://www.samacsys.com/library-loader/](https://www.samacsys.com/library-loader/) in Rust. Why? Well, since the library-loader SamacSys provides only works on Windows, I thought it would be neat to make something similar but available to everyone.
